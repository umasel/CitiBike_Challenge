In this project I am building dashboards and other visualizations using Tableau to relay information about the Citi Bike data from New York City.

Tools
These are the tools, techniques, and resources used in this project.

Tableau is used for creating dashboards and other auxillary visuals

Jupyter Notebook is used to combine the data into one file

About the Data
My visualizations use data from dec 2022 through nov 2023.

# 1. City Official Map

In the CitiBike Challenge, a city map view helps visualize bike stations and usage patterns. It shows where bikes are most and least used and highlights areas with too few or too many stations. This helps improve bike distribution and ensures better service. It also helps identify popular routes and potential areas for expansion.

# 2. Growth %

From this data, August has the highest number of rides at 112,027. This peak in August could be influenced by several factors, such as favorable weather, tourism, or events. Seasonal trends typically show increased outdoor activity during warmer months, which often leads to higher bike usage.

# 3. Seasonal Analysis

The data indicates that Citibike usage peaks at 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. during both summer and winter, which suggests these times align with commuting hours. This pattern is typical in urban bike-sharing systems, reflecting the use of bikes for commuting to and from work or school.

# 4. Top 10 Start and End stations

# Top 10 Start stations
## Classic Bikes:
The majority of rides from all stations are on classic bikes, indicating they are the most popular or most available option. Stations like Hoboken Terminal - Hudson Place (HB101) and Grove St PATH (JC115) have particularly high usage of classic bikes.
## Electric Bikes:
Usage of electric bikes is noticeably lower across all stations compared to classic bikes. However, there are some stations with relatively higher counts, such as Hoboken Terminal - River Street (HB102) and Grove St PATH (JC115), suggesting either a better availability of electric bikes at these locations or a preference for electric bikes for trips starting here.
## Docked Bikes:
The usage of docked bikes is minimal and appears only at specific stations (e.g., Hoboken Terminal - Hudson Place (HB101)). This suggests either a limited availability or lower user preference for docked bikes.

# Top 10 End Stations
## Classic Bikes:
Similar to the start stations, the majority of rides end with classic bikes, indicating they are the most commonly used bike type. Stations like Grove St PATH (JC115) and Hoboken Terminal - River Street (HB102) have particularly high numbers of classic bike returns.
## Electric Bikes:
Electric bike usage is lower compared to classic bikes, but there are noticeable counts at some stations, such as Hoboken Terminal - River Street (HB102) and Grove St PATH (JC115). This suggests these stations might be popular end points for trips involving electric bikes.
## Docked Bikes:
Docked bike usage remains minimal across end stations, appearing mainly at Hoboken Terminal - Hudson Place (HB101) and Hamilton Park (JC009). This indicates limited use or availability of docked bikes.

# 5. Ryder Type Analysis

## Electric Bikes: 
Higher usage in spring (April and May) suggests a seasonal preference or promotions. There is a decline in usage in August, possibly due to availability issues or a shift in user preference towards classic bikes for summer rides.
## Classic Bikes: 
Consistently higher usage in summer, particularly in August, indicates a preference for classic bikes for casual trips and recreation.
## General Trends: 
Seasonal variations affect bike usage, with electric bikes being popular in cooler months for longer commutes, while classic bikes are favored in warmer months for leisure. Infrastructure and accessibility also influence these patterns.
